# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Modifying `Event.ts` to support multiple field types directly and updating `repository.ts` accordingly.

## Recent Changes

- Created `Item`, `FieldType`, `Field`, and `EventValue` interfaces in `Event.ts`.
- Updated the `Event` interface in `Event.ts` to use the new interfaces.
- Modified `repository.ts` to handle the new data structures, including type conversions during data retrieval.

## Next Steps

- Test the changes to ensure data is stored and retrieved correctly with different field types.
- Implement data validation to enforce field type constraints.
- Consider how these changes will affect the UI and update the UI components accordingly.

## Active Decisions

- The `EventValue` interface stores values as `string | number | null` to accommodate different field types. This requires type conversions during data retrieval.
