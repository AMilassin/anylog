## Anylog Specification

### **Overview**

Anylog is a highly customizable logging application designed to help users track various aspects of their daily lives. The system is built around two core components: **Items and Fields**, allowing for structured and flexible data entry.

---

### **Core Structure**

- **Items** → User-defined entities for tracking (e.g., Running, Meditation, Sleep, Pain Level)
- **Fields** → Unique per item (e.g., "Distance" for Running but not for Meditation)
- **Field Types** → System-defined (e.g., Integer, Float, String, FloatScale10)

---

## **1. Items**

Items are **user-defined entities** that users can create, modify, and delete. Each item represents something the user wants to track, such as activities, states, supplements, food, or events.

Example Items:

- Running
- Meditation
- Stress Level
- Vitamin D
- Coffee
- Workout Session

---

## **2. Fields & Field Types**

### **Fields**

- Fields are **unique to each item**, meaning different items can have different fields based on what needs to be tracked
- Users define **field names** when creating an item but must select from system-defined **field types**

### **Field Types (System-Defined)**

| Field Type           | Description           | Example Use                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Integer**          | Whole numbers only    | "Steps Taken" (5000 steps)            |
| **Float**            | Decimal numbers       | "Distance" (5.2 km)                   |
| **String**           | Free text             | "Book Title" (Atomic Habits)          |
| **FloatScale10**     | Scale between 1-10    | "Pain Level" (7.5)                    |
| **Timestamp (Auto)** | Auto-filled by system | "Workout Start" (2025-02-22 07:00:00) |
| **Enum (Dropdown)**  | Predefined choices    | "Yoga Type" (Hatha, Vinyasa)          |

- **FloatScale10** is fixed at a 1-10 scale
- **Timestamp** is automatically generated by the system but can be edited
- **Enum (Dropdown)** allows predefined choices, but the values must be defined when creating the field

## **3. Item Definition Examples**

| Item       | Field Name | Type         | Unit       |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Running    | Distance   | Float        | Kilometers |
|            | Duration   | Integer      | Minutes    |
|            | Intensity  | FloatScale10 | -          |
| Meditation | Duration   | Integer      | Minutes    |
|            | Technique  | String       | -          |
| Anxiety    | Level      | FloatScale10 | -          |
|            | Notes      | String       | -          |
| Pain       | Intensity  | FloatScale10 | -          |
|            | Location   | String       | -          |

## **4. Item Creation Steps**

1️⃣ **Step 1: Define an Item**

- User names the item (e.g., "Yoga Session")

2️⃣ **Step 2: Add Fields**

- Users define field names but must select from predefined field types

3️⃣ **Step 3: Save & Start Logging**

- The new item is created and ready for logging

## **5. Example Workflow: Logging an Activity**

### **Scenario**

A user, Alex, wants to track their **Yoga Sessions**, including details such as duration, type of yoga, and perceived intensity.

### **Steps**

1. **Alex opens the Anylog app and navigates to the dashboard**
2. **Alex selects "Customize" to define a new item**
3. **Alex creates a new item named "Yoga Session"**
4. **Alex defines the following fields:**
   - **Duration** → Integer (Minutes)
   - **Type of Yoga** → String
   - **Intensity** → FloatScale10 (1 = light, 10 = max effort)
5. **Alex logs a Yoga Session with the following details:**
   - **Duration:** 45 minutes
   - **Type of Yoga:** Vinyasa
   - **Intensity:** 7.5
   - **Timestamp is auto-filled**
6. **Alex reviews and analyzes past yoga sessions over time**
