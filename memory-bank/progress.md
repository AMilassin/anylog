# Progress

## What Works

- Basic app structure is in place (React Native, Expo, TypeScript).
- Database schema is designed and implemented.

## What's Left to Build

- User authentication and authorization (if required).
- Testing and refinement of data storage and retrieval, including type handling.
- Data validation and error handling.
- UI updates to reflect the changes in data structures.

## Current Status
